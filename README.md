# react-forum

A cheap copy of reddit as a school assignment. Doesn't really have a backend -
it uses a [mock server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).

## How to run

Clone the repo and run these commands:

```shell
$ npm i               # install dependencies
$ npm run dev         # start the client
$ npm run mock-server # start the mock server
```

And open http://localhost:5173/
